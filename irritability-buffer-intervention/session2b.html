              example, if the Irritability Buffer window calculates to 5 hours and 6 minutes, and efficiency is low, round down to a
              5-hour window.</span>

              time for your Irritability Buffer window based on your needs (e.g., if you must wake at 7 AM, your 5-hour window might
              be from 2 AM to 7 AM). Keep this window consistent daily, even on weekends.</span>
