      <h4 class="sections-title mb-3">Interpersonal Skills​</h4>
      <p>Your interpersonal skills play a crucial role in how you connect and network with others, typically on a
        one-on-one basis. These skills are essential in various aspects of daily life, including friendships and
        workplaces as well as socio-cultural factors and environmental factors. Your interpersonal relationships
        encompass daily interactions and effective communication with coworkers, and family.</p>
      <p>Enhancing your interpersonal skills fosters a more collaborative workplace culture. Research shows that
        employees working in companies <strong>that value cooperation and teamwork</strong>—core components of
        interpersonal skills—<strong>experience higher job satisfaction, reduced stress, and greater mental and physical
          health.</strong></p>

      <h4 class="sections-title mb-3">Interpersonal Relationships At Work​​</h4>
      <p>Interpersonal relationships in the workplace involve cordial interactions among employees, including both
        formal and informal conversations. These relationships span across all hierarchical or generational levels of
        coworkers. As you review the graphic below, consider which environment you most closely identify with.</p>

      <p>A healthy workplace culture has been linked to improved mental health outcomes for employees, while an
        unhealthy workplace culture is associated with higher levels of stress and burnout. This findings emphasize the
        importance of fostering a supportive environment to enhance employee mental health and well-being.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Building Strong Interpersonal Relationships: Keys to Personal and Workplace Success​
      </h4>
      <p>Think about the time you first met your best friend. Do you remember how it was that you became friends in the
        first place? What were the moments that led to you becoming best friends?</p>
      <p>These shared experiences and exchanges built the relationship you have now. Research shows that interpersonal
        relationships grow stronger through sharing knowledge and experiences, influenced by the context of your
        meetings.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">In the workplace, these interpersonal relationships are built on the following factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-1">Completing tasks within deadlines</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Achieving specific goals</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Friendships</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Social support</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Search for approval</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Need of information</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Seeking reassurance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Can you think of any other factors that allowed you to build relationships with your colleagues?</p>

      <div class="d-flex align-items-center flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">
        <div>
          <p>As we mentioned, sharing information about yourself and communicating general knowledge with others helps
            you improve your interpersonal skills with friends, family, and colleagues. </p>
          <p>When you meet someone who shares your values or beliefs you are more likely to form a strong interpersonal
            relationship. These relationships thrive with open, honest communication, and the willingness to invest time
            and effort in maintaining and building the connection.</p>

      <p>An interpersonal relationship involves active communication. The more you share about yourself and listen to
        others, the more likely they are to do the same. This mutual exchange fosters comfort and encourages both
        parties to spend time nurturing the relationship.</p>
    </section>
