              Main Characteristics of Interpersonal Skills
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-4">Interpersonal skills not only benefit your mental health but also enhance the overall
              well-being of those around you. By surrounding yourself with people from various backgrounds and showing
              understanding, empathy, concern, and politeness, you demonstrate great interpersonal skills. Here are the
              main characteristics of a person with strong interpersonal skills:​</p>

              Enhancing Mental Health Through Strong Interpersonal Skills and Healthy Workplace Culture​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-4">Your interpersonal skills along with your workplace culture play a major role in your mental
              health and wellness. Your personal and professional life’s stressors can contribute to negative mental
              health outcomes when they are present for a long period of time. Through the factors below, you along with
              your workplace can promote and improve employee mental health:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-1"> <strong>Supportive Environment:</strong> Foster a culture of support and understanding.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Encourage open and honest dialogue.​</li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Promote policies that help balance personal and
                professional responsibilities.​</li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Recognition and Appreciation:</strong> Acknowledge and value employees'
                contributions.​</li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Stress Management Resources:</strong> Provide tools and resources to manage
                stress effectively.​</li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Professional Development:</strong> Offer opportunities for growth and learning.​​
              </li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Empathy and Compassion:</strong> Cultivate a workplace where empathy and
                compassion are practiced regularly.​</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">On the other hand, studies have shown that an unfavorable workplace—characterized by a lack
              of social support, poor work-life balance, excessive job demands, and insufficient policies—can negatively
              impact employee mental health and well-being.</p>

              Types of Communication Skills​
            </h5>
            <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column flex-md-row mb-3">
              <div>
                <p>In the previous session, we explored four basic communication skills. In this session, we will build
                  on your effective communication skills by focusing on three main types of communication skills:
                  assertive communication, conversational communication, and non-verbal communication.</p>
                <p class="mb-1">Each of these skills will enhance your interpersonal abilities by promoting open, clear,
                  and active communication with others.</p>

              <h5 class="sections-title">
                Assertive Communication
              </h5>
              <p class="mb-4">An assertive style of communication balances your needs with those of others. It involves
                being accommodating while setting necessary boundaries. In this approach, your attitude and expression
                should be calm, confident, and considerate.​​</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-5 ml-4">
              <h5 class="sections-title">
                Conversational Communication​
              </h5>
              <p class="mb-4">A conversational style of communication involves the ability to exchange ideas,
                information, and feedback, and to work collaboratively to solve problems. In the workplace, effective
                conversational communication enhances productivity, boosts employee satisfaction, and contributes to
                long-term success.</p>

            <div class="mb-5 ml-4">
              <h5 class="sections-title">
                Non-Verbal Communication
              </h5>
              <p class="mb-4">Non-verbal communication plays a significant role in building interpersonal skills. It
                encompasses everything we convey with our bodies, such as eye contact, tone of voice, and body posture.
                These non-verbal cues can send powerful messages to those around us, regardless of what we say verbally.
                Therefore, it's crucial to be mindful of both our words and our actions.</p>
              <p class="mb-1">When you are about to talk to someone, take a quick second to think about the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="mb-1">How are you feeling?</li>
                <li class="mb-1">How interested are you in the conversation or situation?</li>
                <li class="mb-1">How much do you know about the specific topic being discussed?​</li>
                <li class="mb-1">What is your stance or view on the topic?​</li>
                <li class="mb-1">Are you being open and honest about what you are communicating?​</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Reflecting on these questions can help you engage more effectively and authentically.</p>

            <h4 class="sections-title">Next Steps</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">Managing interpersonal relationships can be overwhelming. Having an open, active
              communication with those around you takes time and practice to nurture a sense of positivity and improve
              the mental health for yourself and those in your environment. </p>
            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Do the following:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-inline order-list">
              <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">1. Reflect:</span> Who do you have the best interactions
                with? What are the key components to those interactions that make it good and effective?</li>
              <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">2. Review:</span> Look back at the communication skills and
                think about what your strengths are in the context of non-verbal communication specifically.​</li>
              <li class="mb-5"><span class="intial-concept">3. Test:</span> Asses your knowledge (below) about what you
                have learned in this session.</li>

          <div>
            <hr class="short-line-left">
            <h4 class="sections-title">Finish and Test Your Knowledge</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">Now it’s time to see how much you understood in this session. These questions are simply
              meant
              to help you get the most out of this session and are not graded or scored!</p>
