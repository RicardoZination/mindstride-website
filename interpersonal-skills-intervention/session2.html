              Influences of Interpersonal Skills
            </h5>
            <p>Your interpersonal skills are influenced in two ways: internally and externally.</p>
            <p>​We will delve into these influences shortly. The interpersonal skills you display now are a mix of what
              you were taught as a child, what you learned in school, your work environment, and contextual clues from
              your surroundings. ​</p>
            <p>One common factor in all these influences is <strong>you</strong>. You decide how and when to demonstrate
              your interpersonal skills to the best of your ability. As you read the next sections, reflect on how these
              influences have shaped your own interpersonal skills.</p>

              <h4 class="sections-title">Internal Influences​</h4>
              <div class="d-flex align-items-center flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">

                <div>
                  <p>Internal influences are unique to you and involve the personality traits you are born with—what
                    makes you, you. These include inherent characteristics, abilities, and competencies, such as your
                    need for affection, inclusion, and control, all of which play a key role in how you interact with
                    others. These internal factors make you distinct and unique from anyone else.​</p>

                <div>
                  <p>External influences encompass your environment and the people you interact with. For example, the attitudes and culture within your workplace can affect how you and your colleagues interact and accomplish tasks. As we mentioned earlier, observing others in your environment provides contextual clues, allowing you to respond in ways that are socially meaningful and suited to your work context.​​</p>

              Communication Skills​
            </h4>
            <p>Communication skills are pivotal in improving your interpersonal skills. Effective communication involves not only the exchange of words but also non-verbal behavior. These skills include listening, speaking, writing, facial expressions, body language, vocal cues, and behavior. While this may seem overwhelming, you already practice many of these skills naturally.</p>
            <p>Now, the focus is on identifying which areas you want to improve to enhance your interpersonal skills and boost your mental health and well-being.​</p>

              Science Behind Understanding Others​
            </h5>
            <p>In addition to communication skills, interpersonal skills rely on understanding others' perspectives and experiences. Even if you haven't gone through a similar situation, practicing empathy and compassion allows you to connect with others.</p>
            <p>Building these skills can nurture relationships, enhance mindfulness, and improve your mental health. Studies indicate the people with higher levels of empathy work more efficiently and productively as to the fulfillment of their role in creating social change. Additionally, research shows empathy can lessen your stress and burnout in the workplace, and also adds to your quality of life.</p>
