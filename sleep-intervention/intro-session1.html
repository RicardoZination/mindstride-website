      <p>Welcome to "Strides for Better Sleep," a program grounded in science and designed to improve your sleep quality
        through a variety of strategies. Whether used together or individually, these strategies aim to pinpoint and
        alter habits and routines that could be interfering with a good night's rest.</p>
      <p>Sleep isn't just a nightly necessity—it's a pillar of our overall health and happiness. It plays a crucial role
        in our physical health, memory, focus, performance, mood, and overall sense of well-being. Experiencing trouble
        sleeping at some point is common for everyone, but persistent sleep issues can lead to feelings of sadness or
        anxiety. Given the vital role sleep plays in our daily lives, disruptions in our sleep pattern can significantly
        affect our day-to-day activities and how we feel overall.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Session Summary</h4>
      <p>In this first session, we delve into the essential function of rest in our lives, guided by our body clock and
        the need for sleep that intensifies the longer we're awake. We cycle through five stages of sleep throughout the
        night, each with distinct physical responses, from light dozing to the deep rest where dreams unfold.
      </p>
      <p>We also offer practical tips for better sleep hygiene — from limiting caffeine to maintaining a consistent
        sleep routine — to help improve the quality of your rest.

        <li class="paragraph"><span class="intial-concept">Understand the Role of the Body Clock in Sleep:</span> Learn
          that sleep is a vital rest period controlled by how long we've been awake and our body clock, which together

      <h4 class="sections-title">What is Sleep?</h4>
      <p>First, let's talk about what sleep actually is. Sleep is a time of rest and is regulated by two systems
        including our need for sleep and our internal body clock. As we stay awake longer, we feel sleepier—a sign our
        body needs rest. Our body clock, also known as the circadian rhythm, runs on a 24-hour cycle and affects
        functions like temperature, blood pressure, and hormone levels. Getting good sleep depends on these two systems
        working together.</p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-column flex-md-row">
        <div class="circadian-rhythm-text">
          <p>Our internal clock runs on a 24-hour cycle and influences many functions in our body, including our
            temperature, blood pressure, and hormone levels.</p>
          <p>If you look at the picture to the right, you will see both the awake section and the asleep section. When
            these two systems – the need for sleep and the circadian rhythm – are in sync, we tend to have good quality
            sleep.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">The 5 Stages of Sleep</h4>
      <p>Now, let's dive into the stages of sleep. During the night, we go through five different stages of sleep, each
        lasting about 90 minutes. We cycle through these stages 4-5 times each night.</p>

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li><span class="list-title">S1. Transition to Sleep:</span> <br /> is when we start to fall asleep. Our
            muscles relax, and it's easy to wake up.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S2. Light Sleep:</span> <br /> Our breathing and heart rate slow down. We spend
            about half our sleep time in this stage.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S3. Deep Sleep:</span> <br /> Our breathing and heart rate are at their lowest,
            and it's harder to be woken up.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S4. Deeper Sleep:</span> <br /> Our breathing and heart rate are regular, and the
            muscle activity are at a minimum.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S5. REM Sleep:</span> <br /> This is where dreaming occurs. Our blood pressure
            and heart rate go up, but our body remains very still.</li>

          <h4 class="sections-title">How Much Sleep Do We Really Need?</h4>
          <p class="clock-text">Everyone's sleep needs are different. Most adults need between 5 to 10 hours of sleep,
            with 7 hours being ideal for many. As we get older, our sleep patterns change, and we spend more time in
            lighter sleep stages (S1 & S2).</p>

      <p>Sleep Hygiene is about adopting a set of practices that can significantly enhance the quality of your sleep. If
        sleep has been elusive or not restful for you, trying out these guidelines comprehensively and consistently over
        time may offer substantial benefits.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title section-4">Keep a Sleep Journal</h4>
      <p>To monitor the effectiveness of these strategies, maintain a sleep journal over the next two weeks.</p>
      <span class="list-title">Record the following:</span>
      <ul class="list-inline order-list">
        <li class="mb-1">1. The times you go to bed at night and wake up in the morning.</li>
        <li class="mb-1">2. When you first fell asleep and when you finally woke up.</li>
        <li class="mb-1">3. Any periods you were awake during the night and for how long.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This journal will help you understand your sleep patterns, calculate sleep efficiency, and determine your
        average sleep duration weekly.</p>
      <p>By closely following these steps and documenting your progress, you can significantly improve your sleep
        quality and overall well-being. Here is a sample Sleep Journal - you will have an opportunity to download the
        journal and you will learn more in Session 2.</p>
