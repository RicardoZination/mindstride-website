            <p>In this second session, we will explore the cycle of anxiety by looking at how a stressful situations may
              affect our experience of anxiety. While anxiety can present itself for a short period of time until the
              event or thought has passed, anxiety can also be present for a long period of time. In this case, it can
              have more detrimental health effects to not only your mental health, but also your overall well-being. In
              this session, we will also increase your knowledge about what you can do to reverse the cycle of anxiety
              and disrupt anxious thinking before it takes a toll on your mental health and ability to cope with
              stressors.</p>

              The Cycle of Anxiety
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Anxiety often starts because we worry about a potential threat, which is usually a belief rather than a fact.</p>
            <p class="mb-3"> You might experience anxious thoughts by focusing on "what ifs" in a situation and doubting your ability to handle it. This is known as the Cycle of Anxiety.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Take a moment to look at the chart and think about how you have dealt with this cycle before this session.</p>

              Factors Contributing to Anxiety
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Think about a time when you felt anxious or knew you would feel anxious because of an upcoming situation or event. What did you do then? You probably did something to reduce those anxious thoughts. What was it?</p>

              Avoidance and Safety Behaviors
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Imagine you have something important to do, but instead of facing it, you avoid it completely. This is called <span class="intial-concept">avoidance.</span></p>
            <p class="mb-3">Avoidance might make you feel better for a short while, like "out of sight, out of mind." However, it can make things worse in the long run.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">For example, say your friend's birthday is coming up, and you need to buy a gift from the mall. You avoid the mall because it's crowded and noisy. Instead, you stay home and scroll through your phone, feeling less anxious for now. This scrolling is a <span class="intial-concept">safety behavior</span>, a distraction to avoid anxiety. Other safety behaviors might include taking medications, baking, or cleaning.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">But you still need to get that gift. What was once a simple task now bringing many anxious thoughts: What if I don’t get anything? How will I show up without a gift? What if the mall doesn't have what I want anymore?</span></p>
            <p class="mb-3">In the long term, <span class="intial-concept">avoiding situations like this increases your anxiety.</span> You start looking for danger everywhere, making you more anxious about imagined situations.​</p>

              "What Ifs": Uncovering Unhelpful Thoughts
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Anxiety often makes us imagine the worst scenarios. While this can sometimes help us prepare, it can also be exhausting to always think about <strong>"what ifs."</strong>  These thoughts are usually overly negative and unrealistic, especially when there's no real danger.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">By shifting our thinking to be more realistic, we can see things more clearly and objectively, based on facts. This takes time and patience, but with practice, it becomes easier to use more realistic thinking instead of falling into an anxious cycle.</p>
