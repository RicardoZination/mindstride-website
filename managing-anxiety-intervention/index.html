      <p>In this first session, we will explore what anxiety is and help you recognize when anxious thoughts and actions
        are affecting your body. Anxiety can come and go throughout the day, week, or month. It's not always entirely
        good or entirely bad. Sometimes, it can boost your energy, but if it lasts too long, it can lead to exhaustion.
        You will learn about the different causes of anxiety and how these can vary from person to person.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Causes of Anxiety</h4>
      <p>There are several factors that can cause anxiety, and they can be different for each person. Research shows
        that these factors can be biological, psychological, and social. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Biological factors:</span>
          These are things you are born with, like your genetics and brain chemistry.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Psychological factors:</span>These are related to your lifestyle,
          such as your thoughts, behaviors, and ways of coping with stress.</li>
        <li class="mb-3"><span class="intial-concept">Social factors:</span>These involve your life experiences and
          early learning, including your relationships, environment, and events you've been through.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Everyone's experience with anxiety is unique because these factors combine in different ways for each person.

      <h4 class="sections-title">The Fight or Flight Response</h4>
      <p>When we face immediate stress, our body's automatic survival mechanism kicks in to deal with the threat or danger, whether it's real or imagined. This is known as the fight or flight response. During this response, the body makes several changes to prepare us to either confront the threat or run away from it. While anxiety can feel intense, it's not harmful by itself; it simply puts the body in a state of alertness to handle the situation.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h4 class="sections-title">What is happening in the body?</h4>
      <p>When our body goes into fight or flight mode, our mind signals that there's immediate danger. The main purpose of the fight or flight response is to protect us. When this response is activated, three major systems are affected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Physical (Body):</span>
          Your body undergoes changes like increased heart rate and muscle tension.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Cognitive (Thinking):</span>Your thoughts become focused on the danger and how to respond to it.</li>
        <li class="mb-3"><span class="intial-concept">Behavioral (Actions): </span>You either prepare to confront the threat or run away from it. Sometimes, people may also experience a freeze response. This happens when the body is in shock or facing extreme stress, causing you to feel stuck and unable to move.</li>
      </ul>
