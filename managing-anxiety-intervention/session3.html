              Steps to Avoid Jumping to Conclusions
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Do you often find yourself overthinking? Jumping to conclusions can happen by making assumptions about what others think of you or the situation, like mind-reading; or making assumptions about what will happen in the near future, like fortune-telling. This can make it difficult to see things clearly and makes it more possible for you to make poor decisions. This, coupled with anxiety, can take a toll in your relationships, confidence, and motivation. Keep reading along to learn how to become aware of your thoughts and actions to work with more accurate outcomes.</p>
