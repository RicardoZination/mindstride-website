      <p>Welcome to "Strides for Managing Stress," a science-based program designed to help you cope with stress using a
        variety of strategies. Whether you use these strategies together or individually, they will help you understand,
        identify, and adjust the stressors in your daily life for improved well-being.​</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Stress plays a major role in our lives. It can push us to meet new challenges or make us worry
        about deadlines. Stress influences how we act, think, and feel. While it can sometimes boost our energy and
        productivity, it can also lead to fatigue and burnout. By changing the way we think about stress, we can reduce
        its negative effects on our bodies.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Let's begin the first session.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Session Summary</h4>
      <p>In this first session, we explore the role of stress in our lives. Stress can keep us active and alert
        throughout our workday, but experiencing it for too long can lead to fatigue and burnout.
      </p>
      <p>We will examine various ways that stress manifests in our minds and bodies. Whether real or imagined, these
        stressors can persist and impact our mental health and well-being. Through interactive activities and reflective
        exercises, we will explore different strategies to reduce high levels of stress.

      <h4 class="sections-title mb-3">Understanding Stress</h4>
      <p>Stress is the body's response to any demand that requires adaptation. Our bodies like to maintain balance,
        known as homeostasis, which is a state of internal stability needed for proper functioning. When stress disrupts
        this balance, the body works to restore it.</p>
      <p>The causes of stress are called stressors. These stressors can be real and physical, like an injury, or they
        can be perceived or imagined, like worrying about an upcoming event. Understanding both types of stressors helps
        us better manage our stress levels.</p>
      <p>Stress depends on how you perceive what's happening around you and inside your mind. Stressors typically fall
        into one of two categories: internal or external.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title mb-4">The Fight or Flight Response</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">When we face immediate stress, our body's automatic survival mechanism kicks in, known as the
        <strong>fight or flight response.</strong> This response prepares us to either confront the stressor or escape
        from it.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">During this response, our body undergoes several changes to help us adapt and overcome the stress.
        While these physiological changes might feel unsettling, they are essential for helping us manage and respond to
        immediate threats.​</p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h4 class="sections-title">What is happening in the body?</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">When our body goes into fight or flight mode, our mind signals immediate danger. This triggers a
        series of changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-1"><strong>Increased metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate: </strong>These changes prepare us
          for quick action.</li>
        <li class="mb-1"><strong>Muscle tension:</strong> Often felt in the head, shoulders, and neck.</li>
        <li class="mb-1"><strong>Shortness of breath:</strong> Breathing becomes rapid and shallow.</li>
        <li><strong>Nausea or butterflies in the stomach:</strong> A common reaction to stress.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-3">These are normal body responses to stress. Sometimes, people experience a freeze response, where
        the body feels stuck or in shock due to extreme stress.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">We will discuss the long-term effects of stress on your body further into the session.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Next Steps</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">Stress can be complex to navigate especially if we cannot pinpoint what we may be feeling. Let's
        explore more of that in the next session and determine what are some causes of stress in your life. We will help
        you decrease your stress load and continue to build your toolkit on what you know about stress.</p>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong>Do the folowing</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-inline order-list">
        <li class="mb-1">1. Download the Daily Stressor Sheet (PDF format) and begin identifying where your stress load
          is for the next session (we will build on this exercise for the next session).</li>
        <li class="mb-1">2. Review the Fight or Flight Response and see if you have experienced this response. If so,
          how?</li>
