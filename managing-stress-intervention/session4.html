            <p>In Session 4, we focus on preventing and managing everyday stress. Managing stress requires time,
              patience, and the ability to identify the sources of your stress. Are they external (out of your control)
              or internal (stemming from your feelings, perceptions, or thoughts)?​</p>
            <p>By making lifestyle changes and learning healthy coping strategies, you can enhance your well-being and
              avoid long-term health complications.​</p>

              Well-being in Routine​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">What does a typical day in your life look like? For example, you might start with a cup of
              coffee, get ready for work, commute, complete tasks at your job, run errands like going to the bank or
              grocery shopping, and then return home for dinner and a favorite show. Alternatively, your daily routine
              might vary, with each day looking different.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">When we have a routine, we can set expectations and contingency plans if things don’t go as
              planned. This is harder to do when your day is unpredictable. Using the Stress Load Table below, write
              down a typical day in your life and note any modifications or improvements that can reduce the stress load
              of each task.​</p>

              The Power of Self-Talk in Managing Stress
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">What we say to ourselves greatly impacts our ability to handle stress. For example, when
              things don't go as planned, do you think, "Oh no, this is the worst!" or "Don't worry, I've got this"?
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Positive thinking can reduce stress by fostering a compassionate and understanding
              self-dialogue.​</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Self-affirmations are also effective in shifting your mindset. By giving yourself support
              and encouragement, rather than being harsh or judgmental, you can better manage the stress in your life.​

              The Benefits of Movement in Reducing Stress
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Any form of movement during the day can help your body shift towards relaxation rather than
              stress.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Regular exercise, even just 15 minutes a day, can balance your stress load. It could be a
              short walk or a long hike, whatever fits your schedule.​</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Set a daily movement goal. Choose activities that bring you joy, like going out with
              friends, gardening, biking, or weight training. Listen to your body as you exercise. </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Start with what you're comfortable with, and gradually expand your range when you feel
              ready.</p>

            <h5 class="sections-title mb-5">
              Social Support is Key in Managing Stress
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Leaning on your social support network during stressful times can help you navigate and
              discuss what's causing your stress. Your support system may be able to help, preventing you from feeling
              alone in your stress.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Who can you talk to during these times? Is it family, a particular friend, a loved one, or a
              trusted colleague? Identify someone you can vent to or find solutions with. Do you have regular contact
              with them? Do they also reach out to you in times of stress?​</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Consider others beyond your current support network. Reach out and have a chat—it may help
              reduce your stress load and make practical decisions easier.

              Eat Well to Control Stress
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">A balanced meal, especially during stressful times, can set a positive tone for the rest of
              your day. While it's okay to enjoy a treat, remember that it alone isn't a full meal and may even increase
              stress symptoms.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">Here are some suggestions for balanced meals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
              <li class="mb-1"><strong>Avoid excessive sugar and caffeine:</strong> These can spike stress levels.</li>
              <li class="mb-3"><strong>Snack smartly:</strong> Opt for nuts, fruits, or yogurt instead of processed snacks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-3">Eating well can help you manage stress and maintain your overall health.
