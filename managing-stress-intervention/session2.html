            <p>In this second session, we investigate the impact of stress in the brain. We look at the different parts
              of the brain that are involved when we are experiencing stress. We will also examine the different levels
              of stress over time and how they impact your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours if stress persists. </p>
            <p>As different forms of stress affect your day-to-day activities, we will build your ability to recognize
              the signs and symptoms of stress, and how to adequately respond to them to prevent exhaustion and burnout.

              The Spectrum of Stress and Performance

            <p class="mb-5">As stress increases, our performance improves up to an optimal point. However, if stress
              continues to rise, it eventually leads to a suboptimal point where performance and efficiency decline.

            <p class="mb-3"><strong>Acute Stress:</strong>Short-term stress occurs when you feel pressured in a specific
              situation. A certain level of acute stress keeps you alert and focused. However, high levels of acute
              stress can be unpleasant and reduce performance. This type of stress is best managed with mental or
              physical stress management techniques, which will be discussed in the</p>
            <p class="mb-5"><strong>Chronic Stress:</strong>Long-term stress happens when stressors accumulate over
              time. Sustained chronic stress can lead to serious physical and mental health problems if not addressed.
              Managing chronic stress involves lifestyle changes, adjusting attitudes, and improving your environment.

              Different Forms of Stress
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-1">Not all stress is bad! <strong>Eustress</strong> is the good kind of stress that energizes
              us and boosts creativity. On the other hand, <strong>distress</strong> can harm self-esteem, cause
              fatigue, and lead to health issues if it persists for too long.</p>

              Recognizing Stress Signs and Symptoms
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Recognizing stress signs and symptoms requires patience and self-awareness.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Monitoring your stress-related symptoms across different life stages is crucial for your
              health and well-being. For instance, a university student may juggle classes, commuting, social life, and
              student loans, while a government employee might handle commuting, tight deadlines, budgets, and social
              life. </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Both examples involve valid internal and external stressors. It’s important to recognize how
              our bodies respond to these stressors and build resilience for our well-being.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">As you go through this session and learn about the different types of symptoms, remember to
              consider where you might find yourself on the stress spectrum we discussed earlier.</p>
