            <p>In this third session, we will build your capacity to appraise the good and bad stress that may appear in
              your life. Some forms of stress may boost your productivity and keep you going, while the other can do the
              opposite and set negative mental health outcomes that take a toll on your overall health. In this session
              we invite you to complete the worksheet to get to know how much stress may be affecting your quality of
              life.</p>

              Appraising Stressors in your Daily Life​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-1">Stress impacts how our body works, how we act, think, and feel. When stressed, our bodies
              often become tense and enter the 'fight or flight' mode. Our responses can vary based on our personality
              and circumstances.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Now that we've identified whether stressors are internal or external, let's determine if
              they bring good stress (eustress) or bad stress (distress) into our lives. Use the Stress Appraisal table
              below to categorize the causes of your stress as either eustress or distress.​</p>
            <div class="text-center mb-5">
              <img src="../assets/stress-daily-life-table.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
            <p class="mb-4">Notice how your mind appraises each stressor. Is it a fun challenge, an exciting adventure,
              or a thrilling road trip? This is eustress. Or is it a dreadful task or a frustrating discussion? This is
              distress. Remember, your feelings may not always be clear-cut—you can feel multiple ways about a
              situation, and that’s completely okay!​</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Using the right side of the table, give each item a score from 1 to 10, with 1 being the
              lowest possible level of stress it causes you today and 10 being the highest.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">​Practice this exercise for two weeks while applying the techniques to prevent and manage
              stress from the next session. We will then discuss any changes in your original scores from Day 1.​</p>

            <p class="mb-3">Now it’s time to see how much you understood in this session. These questions are simply
              meant
              to help you get the most out of this session and are not graded or scored!</p>
