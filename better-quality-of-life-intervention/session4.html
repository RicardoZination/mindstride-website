                however, if you find yourself not being able to sleep in your bed, we suggest you do something that will
                promote mindfulness and relaxation to help you wind down from an eventful day.</li>

              negative, stressful thinking and engage with the world around you. We suggest these helpful thinking
              strategies to keep you on track on improving your quality of life:</p>
