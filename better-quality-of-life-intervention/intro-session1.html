      <p>We often hear the term "quality of life," but what does it mean for you?</p>
      <p>Do you believe you have a good quality of life?</p>
      <p>What is your viewpoint on quality of life?</p>
      <div class="d-flex align-items-center flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">
        <div>
          <p>Answering these questions may take more than just one sentence because quality of life is quite complex.
            It's highly subjective, meaning it's based on your own perception and circumstances.</p>
          <p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> World Health Organization defines quality of life as an
            individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which
            they live, and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Quality of Life and Mental Health​</h4>
      <p>Mental health, like any other facet of quality of life, plays a crucial role in shaping a person's perception
        of their quality of life. For instance, someone living with anxiety or depression may find their symptoms
        disrupt daily activities or make tasks feel overwhelming. Your mental health can either support or hinder your
        ability to complete daily tasks.</p>
      <p>Those with a mental illness or who experience symptoms know that some days are manageable while others require
        stepping back to handle symptoms. ​</p>
      <p>This journey offers a unique and valid perspective on quality of life.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h4 class="sections-title">Understanding the Key Domains of Quality of Life​</h4>
      <p>You can also think of your quality of life as the degree to which you enjoy the important possibilities of
        life. These possibilities arise from the opportunities and limitations each person faces, reflecting the
        interaction between personal and environmental factors. For example, if you live in a home with a lot of green
        space, you are more likely to use your outdoor areas compared to someone living in a densely populated urban
        area.</p>
      <p>There are three key domains that help determine your quality of life, that we call the <strong>3Bs: Being,
          Belonging, and Becoming.</strong> Take a look at the figure below as we explore each of these domains and
        their subdomains in detail.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Next Steps</h4>
      <p>Quality of life is a complex, multifaceted concept influenced by your life circumstances. It can change as you
        progress through different stages of life. As we move to the next session, reflect on where you currently stand
        in terms of the 3Bs we discussed – Being, Belonging, and Becoming.</p>
