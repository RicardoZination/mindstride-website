            <p>In this session, we will delve into the topic of how living with a mental health condition has an effect
              on quality of life. A mental health condition, regardless of its severity, adds complexity to a person’s
              day-to-day interactions, support networks, and personal beliefs. Let’s get started.​</p>

              Mental Illness and its Role in Quality of Life​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">There are great advantages to improving your quality of life throughout the day that go
              beyond seeing the benefits in your physical health, such as better heart health by increasing your
              movement/exercise time. Studies indicate there are also advantages that prevent and manage mental health
              conditions. People with mental health conditions have noted the aspects below to have a significant role
              in their quality of life. An improvement in quality of life has been proven to help with their
              self-perception, relationships, activities, and wellbeing - to name a few of its benefits.</p>

            <h4 class="sections-title">Next Steps</h4>
            <p>Your mental health and quality of life are linked to self-perception, relationships, autonomy, and hope.
              Living with a mental health condition adds complexity as symptoms change over time. However, these
              symptoms might not affect your perception of quality of life if your interactions and daily functioning
              support your well-being.</p>
            <p class="mb-3"><strong>Try the following:</strong></p>
