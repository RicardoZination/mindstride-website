            <p>In this second session, we will explore the different factors that make you who you are, and how these
              factors ultimately determine your perception of quality of life. The quality-of-life model presented in
              this session will give you an overview of some circumstances you have to consider when self-assessing your
              quality of life on a day-to-day basis.​​</p>

              Quality of Life Model​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Think about your daily routine. Do your family, friends, or colleagues have similar
              lifestyles?​</p>
            <p>Sometimes they might, but it's crucial to remember that everyone experiences life differently. Below, we
              propose a model to explore how various circumstances can affect your quality of life.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-3">The input from your culture, demographic (age, sex, gender, etc.), and your socioeconomic
              conditions receive influence from your family, friends, work, home life, community, health, education, and
              spirituality. In other words, the factors that make you you, from your background, your heritage, how old
              you are, who you see on a regular basis, and the level of your income, are all connected to your own
              person; then there are people (family, friends, colleagues), places (work, community) ,and other factors
              (your health, spirituality, and education) that give you opinions and information on how you view your
              quality of life. In looking at the chart above from left to right, all of these inputs come together to
              determine your quality of life.</p>
            <p class="mb-1">As you continue with these session, reflect on the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-1">Which of these has the most influence in your life?</li>
              <li class="mb-1">How do you feel about each of these inputs?</li>
              <li class="mb-1">Is there one influence that you would like to work on the most?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-5">As you have seen the three domains in the previous section, here we show examples of how
              these are present in your everyday life. We invite you to add what you do around each of these domains by
              downloading the below table and filling it in. ​</p>

          <p>Your view on quality of life can be influenced by factors such as family, friends, work, living situations,
            education, and spirituality. The importance you place on each of these influences can vary based on how much
            they contribute to your overall lifestyle.</p>
          <p class="mb-3"><strong>Try the following:</strong></p>
