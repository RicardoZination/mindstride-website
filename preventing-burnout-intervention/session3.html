              The Link Between Burnout and Mental Health Conditions​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-4">Burnout and mental health conditions are interconnected, creating a cycle where one can lead
              to the other. Research shows that burnout can lead to conditions like depression, anxiety, insomnia, and
              alcohol dependence. It's crucial to monitor your health and wellness when you experience high levels of
              stress at work or in your personal life.​​</p>
