        <div>
          <p>The World Health Organization defines burnout as a syndrome, which includes mental and physical exhaustion,
            resulting from excessive and prolonged stress at the workplace that has not been successfully managed.</p>
          <p>Without addressing the root causes, burnout is likely to recur, potentially causing further harm to your
            mental health and well-being. Ignoring the signs of burnout can lead to more severe consequences. </p>
          <p>By recognizing and addressing its early signs, you can prevent burnout from impacting other areas of your
            life and maintain the energy and ability to meet your job’s demands.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title mb-3">Burnout: What are the Common Causes?</h4>
      <p>Burnout is not just an issue for an individual, but rather a result because of multiple factors from the
        environment at work. Your experiences of stress at work are a response to the greater demands or tasks you may
        have at work and the lesser job resources you may have to complete them. Whether your job demands are physical,
        emotional, or otherwise, they take a toll on your mental health and well-being. </p>
      <p>At an individual level, the causes of burnout include:</p>

      <p class="mb-3">At a situational level at work, there are other factors that could be contributing to you
        experiencing burnout from a lack of balance of the following:​</p>

    <section>
      <h4 class="sections-title">Next Steps</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">Burnout won't resolve itself and can arise from both personal and workplace factors. Stress from your personal life can also contribute. Mental health conditions increase your risk of burnout, and burnout can worsen mental health issues. Stay mindful of your mental health and wellness to reduce the risk of burnout.​</p>
