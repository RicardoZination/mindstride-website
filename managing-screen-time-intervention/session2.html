            <p>In this second session, we will explore how excessive screen time affects you and your mental health. You
              will gain a deeper understanding of how prolonged screen use impacts the brain and become more aware of
              how your behaviors may be influenced by your daily device usage. We will also examine the role of screen
              time in mental health, looking at both positive and negative effects across different stages of life,
              including youth and adulthood.</p>

              What is Happening in the Brain During Screen Time?
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Studies show that increased screen use among adults may negatively impact learning, memory,
              and overall mental health. <strong>Excessive screen time might reduce the cerebral cortex volume</strong>
              - the brain’s outermost layer responsible for processing memory, decision-making and problem-solving
              processes.</p>
            <p class="mb-3"><strong>Watching TV for >= 5 hours per day</strong> is associated with increased risk of
              developing dementia or stroke</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Excessive screen time directly impacts your brain’s functioning. Research indicates that
              adults with <strong>high screen time hours or smartphone addiction presented lower gray matter
                volume.</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-3">Gray matter plays a key role in our daily life functioning (e.g., movement control,
              cognitive and emotional processes). Although gray matter naturally decreases with age, excessive screen
              time accelerates this reduction.​</p>
            <p class="mb-3">While it’s tempting to check overnight notifications and emails, your body isn’t fully awake
              yet. Research has shown that screen light hyper-activates the nervous system, triggering a fight-or-flight
              response and increasing stress and anxiety.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">To mitigate these effects, replace screen time with healthy behaviors, such as exercise,
              social activities, and proper sleep.</p>

                <p>Use of digital devices has significantly increased among kids and teens in recent years. </p>
                <p>The shift to online education and the rise of social media platforms have led to excessive screen
                  time. This excessive screen use is contributing to a decline in mental wellness among teens. For
                  instance, <strong>mental health problems</strong> now affect <strong>10–20% of young</strong> people
                  worldwide. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="mb-3">It is recommended to <strong>limit screen time for kids and teens to 2 hours per
                day.</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-3">Research shows that increased screen time is linked to negative self-perception and a higher
              risk of obesity. The rise of a sedentary lifestyle impacts both adults and youth, as time that could be
              spent on physical or outdoor activities is often replaced with screen-based entertainment.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Additionally, excessive screen time in youth is associated with poor mental health outcomes,
              including screen addiction and cyberbullying. Reducing screen time can help mitigate these risks and
              promote better mental and physical health for kids and teens.</strong></p>

              <div class="img-fluid">
                <p>Studying the effects of screen time is challenging due to the prevalence of technology in the
                  workplace. While technology allows adults to work remotely from home or anywhere in the world, it can
                  also interfere with maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., regular sleep ad physical
                  activities). Balancing screen use with healthy daily practices is essential for maintaining overall
                  well-being.</p>
                <p>Most of the adult population spends its work hours looking at screens, leading to increased rates of
                  screen-based, sedentary activities. Research shows that <strong>increased sedentary time in
                    adults is linked to type 2 diabetes and poor mental health.</strong> Reducing sedentary screen time
                  and
                  incorporating physical activity into daily routines can help mitigate these health risks.</p>
