      <h4 class="sections-title mb-3">Understanding Irritability</h4>
      <p>According to the American Psychological Association, irritability involves excessive and easily triggered
        anger, annoyance, or impatience. People experiencing irritability tend to be impatient and short-tempered,
        quickly reacting with frustration to even minor obstacles. </p>
      <p class="mb-5">While irritability is a natural human emotion, experiencing it in extremes may indicate an
        underlying issue
        that needs to be treated. Persistent and disruptive episodes of irritability can be symptoms of mental health
        conditions like anxiety or depression, or physical issues such as traumatic brain injury or substance abuse
        withdrawal.</p>

        <p>Screen time is the time spent using electronic media, including social media, watching TV, playing on
          computers, laptops, smartphones, handheld devices, and video game consoles.​</p>

      <p class="mb-3">In this digital age, where devices keep us informed and connected, it's crucial to be mindful of
        our health and monitor the time we spend on those media. Our devices enable remote work, keep us in touch with
        friends and family abroad, and help us explore new places and languages. While screen time isn't inherently bad,
        excessive use can lead to negative health outcomes.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">Recent data shows that the average person spends 6.5 hours per day on screens connected to the
            internet. This time corresponds to 42% of waking hours! Excessive screen time can affect your mood and sleep
            habits. While screens offer entertainment and connectivity, limiting screen time benefits both physical and
            mental health.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">Finding a balance between screen time and other activities can be challenging and requires
            adjusting daily habits. Research shows that excessive screen time negatively impacts our brains. So, what is
            considered excessive?</p>

          <p class="mb-3">Social media has become a vital part of everyday communication, facilitating network building,
            increasing social connections and visibility. Research shows that social media is essential for youth to
            develop connections in their lives. Conversely, it can also enforce unrealistic expectations and foster
            comparison, negatively affecting mood and self-esteem. The instant gratification from curated feeds
            maintains or increases your scrolling activity, while shortening your attention span and increasing symptoms
            of depression and anxiety.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">Time flies when you're scrolling and chatting with friends or family on social media. Whether
            watching your favorite movie, browsing your feed, or reading the news, hours can pass before you realize it.
            These hours are often spent sitting or lying down, contributing to a sedentary lifestyle. Research studies
            report that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety, unhealthy
            diet, and poor overall health.</p>

            You may frequently check your daily news updates or notifications, often involving social injustices,
            accidents, or natural disasters. While staying informed is important, it's equally crucial to find balance
            for your health and safety. Constant exposure to negative media can trigger feelings of concern and activate
            your fight-or-flight response, leading to increased anxiety, depressive symptoms, and feelings of isolation.
