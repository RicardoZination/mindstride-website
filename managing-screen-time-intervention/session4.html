              <div>
                <p>Our devices offer endless opportunities to interact with people and content online, from checking
                  news and emails to scrolling through social media, streaming shows, or video-calling friends. The
                  screen time often exceeds the recommended limit of two hours per day.</p>
                <p>Research shows that excessive digital screen use is linked to lower self-reported mental health,
                  including higher levels of depression, perceived stress, and negative moods in adults. </p>
                <p>​
                  It is recommended that adults limit screen time outside of work to less than 2 hours per day. Any
                  additional time should be spent on other activities to reduce or prevent the negative health impacted
                  associated with excessive screen use.</p>

              <p class="mb-3">Spending a lot of time looking at a screen can make it challenging to find ways to
                entertain yourself without relying on technology. Start by reducing your screen time during specific
                parts of the day and observe how it impacts your daily routine. Begin with small changes and notice how
                you feel. If you're looking for activities to replace screen time, try the following:​</p>

              time on your mental and physical health. Limit excessive use of laptops, phones, TVs and other digital
              devices, to less than two hours per day outside of work, especially before bed, as it can negatively
              affect your brain, behavior, and general well-being.​​</p>
