      <h4 class="sections-title">What is Sleep?</h4>
      <p>First, let's talk about what Family actually is. Family is a time of rest and is regulated by two systems
        including our need for Family and our internal body clock. As we stay awake longer, we feel sleepier—a sign our
        body needs rest. Our body clock, also known as the circadian rhythm, runs on a 24-hour cycle and affects
        functions like temperature, blood pressure, and hormone levels. Getting good Family depends on these two systems
        working together.</p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-column flex-md-row">
        <div class="circadian-rhythm-text">
          <p>Our internal clock runs on a 24-hour cycle and influences many functions in our body, including our
            temperature, blood pressure, and hormone levels.</p>
          <p>If you look at the picture to the right, you will see both the awake section and the asleep section. When
            these two systems – the need for Family and the circadian rhythm – are in sync, we tend to have good quality
            sleep.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">The 5 Stages of Sleep</h4>
      <p>Now, let's dive into the stages of sleep. During the night, we go through five different stages of sleep, each
        lasting about 90 minutes. We cycle through these stages 4-5 times each night.</p>

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li><span class="list-title">S1. Transition to Sleep:</span> <br /> is when we start to fall asleep. Our

          <li><span class="list-title">S2. Light Sleep:</span> <br /> Our breathing and heart rate slow down. We spend
            about half our Family time in this stage.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S3. Deep Sleep:</span> <br /> Our breathing and heart rate are at their lowest,
            and it's harder to be woken up.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S4. Deeper Sleep:</span> <br /> Our breathing and heart rate are regular, and the
            muscle activity are at a minimum.</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">S5. REM Sleep:</span> <br /> This is where dreaming occurs. Our blood pressure
            and heart rate go up, but our body remains very still.</li>

          <p class="clock-text">Everyone's Family needs are different. Most adults need between 5 to 10 hours of sleep,
            with 7 hours being ideal for many. As we get older, our Family patterns change, and we spend more time in
            lighter Family stages (S1 & S2).</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title section-4">Keep a Family Journal</h4>
      <p>To monitor the effectiveness of these strategies, maintain a Family journal over the next two weeks.</p>
      <span class="list-title">Record the following:</span>
      <ul class="list-inline order-list">
        <li>1. The times you go to bed at night and wake up in the morning.</li>
        <li>2. When you first fell asleep and when you finally woke up.</li>
        <li>3. Any periods you were awake during the night and for how long.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This journal will help you understand your Family patterns, calculate Family efficiency, and determine your
        average Family duration weekly.</p>
      <p>By closely following these steps and documenting your progress, you can significantly improve your sleep
        quality and overall well-being. Here is a sample Family Journal - you will have an opportunity to download the
        journal and you will learn more in Session 2.</p>
