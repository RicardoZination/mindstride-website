            <p>In this fourth and final session, we will identify strategies that could help reduce irritability and increase your mental health, such as physical exercise and other lifestyle factors. As we have learned, when we are experiencing irritability we can draw from our own skillsets to help you plan and navigate difficult situations. This session further helps you identify the strengths you can rely on to improve your mental health and implement healthy behaviours to see their benefits in your day-to-day activities.​</p>

              Strategies to Reduce Irritability and Enhance  Your Mental Health

            <h5 class="sections-title mb-5">
              A. Identifying Your Skills and Resources
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Take a moment to reflect on the people who support you, such as family, friends, relatives, colleagues, and loved ones. Have you reached out to them when you're feeling irritated?</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Consider your confidence in coping with irritability. Can you work out solutions or strategies during stressful situations? As you read through these sessions, have you noticed if irritability has affected your thoughts, feelings, and actions? Are you taking time for yourself to navigate feelings of irritation?</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Review the checkboxes below and mark the skills and resources you have used or plan to use to reduce irritability in your daily life.</p>

              B. Taking Time for Yourself
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">If you are feeling irritated, it's important to take time for yourself. This helps you reflect, process, and reduce irritation. </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Restart your day with activities you enjoy to improve your mood and overall mental health. These activities can calm your body and mind, help you sleep better, and leave you feeling well-rested. Without taking time to unwind, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and stressed.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Choose an activity to look forward to at the end of the day or week that gives you a break and shifts your mindset to a positive note.​</p>
