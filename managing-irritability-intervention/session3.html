            <p>In this third session, we explore the resources and tools you have available in your life to help you
              navigate difficult situations and experiences of irritability. We often call our friends or family to talk
              about how our day or week has been; do we do the same when we are facing stressful situations? Throughout
              this session, we also explain different forms of communication that could be helpful in interacting with
              others and when we are navigating forms of expression when we feel irritated. Let's get started.​</p>
