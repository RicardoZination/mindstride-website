      <h3 class="sections-title">Introduction</h3>
      <p>When you're irritated, you may become easily upset or frustrated. Often, irritability feels like an
        overreaction to a situation. You might notice your reaction is more intense than necessary, or someone may have
        pointed it out to you (hopefully in a constructive way).</p>
      <p>Feelings of agitation, frustration, and impatience are all signs of irritability. This can negatively impact
        both your personal and professional life. Throughout this intervention, we will explore what irritability is and
        how it presents itself in your body. We'll provide strategies to help you manage and reduce irritability, using
        self-identifying tools and resources to improve your mental health and overall well-being.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title mb-3">Understanding Irritability?</h4>
      <p>According to the American Psychological Association, irritability involves excessive and easily triggered
        anger, annoyance, or impatience. People experiencing irritability tend to be impatient and short-tempered,
        quickly reacting with frustration to even minor obstacles. </p>
      <p>While irritability is a natural human emotion, experiencing it in extremes may indicate an underlying issue
        that needs to be treated. Persistent and disruptive episodes of irritability can be symptoms of mental health
        conditions like anxiety or depression, or physical issues such as traumatic brain injury or substance abuse
        withdrawal.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Multifactorial Causes of Irritability</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">There is no singular trigger for irritability; its causes can be multifactorial, acute, or
        chronic.</p>
      <p class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Occasional Irritability:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can stem from common disruptions like arguments, financial concerns, or work deadlines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Chronic Irritability:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>May result from psychological and physiological factors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Irritability in Children</span></p>
      <p>While some irritability is part of normal development, chronic and severe irritability outbursts may signal an
        underlying mental health condition. Research suggests that irritability in children may be an early predictor of
        anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder later in life. Understanding these potential causes can help in
        addressing , preventing, and managing irritability effectively.</p>
