            <p>In this second session, we will take a further look into your body's response to irritability, including
              the fight or flight response as well as the most common symptoms that you may be experiencing. Although
              irritability varies from person-to-person, there are over-arching characteristics that sets it apart from
              other moods and emotions. We invite you to complete a self-assessment on irritability designed to check-in
              with your feelings, thoughts, actions and signs in your body. Let's get started.</p>

              Understanding Your Body's Response to Irritability
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">You may experience physical sensations when your irritability levels increase. This is your
              body’s way of signaling that you are reacting to stress, fear, or anxiety, indicating a real or perceived
              threat. </p>
            <p class="mb-3">This response is commonly known as the 'fight or flight' response, which prepares you to
              protect yourself or escape the situation.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Take a look at the following diagram to identify how the fight or flight response commonly
              presents itself in your body.</p>

              Seeking Help for Irritability
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Irritability is not considered a mental health condition and therefore cannot be formally
              diagnosed. However, people experiencing irritability should still seek help when needed. Seeking mental
              health care to manage feelings of irritability is very common.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Different psychological interventions can help you understand the root cause of your
              irritability and teach you novel coping mechanisms to better understand and manage your emotions. At your
              next check-in with your Mindstride Team, discuss with them some alternatives to better manage feelings of
              irritability.</p>
