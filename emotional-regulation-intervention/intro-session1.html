      <p>Welcome to "Strides for Emotional Regulation," a science-based program designed to help you navigate emotions
        in a healthy and positive way. These strategies can be used together or individually to enhance your
        understanding of your feelings and emotions in daily life, ultimately improving your thinking patterns and
        mental health.​</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Emotional regulation skills can be learned and improved over time. You may notice that some people
        are better at regulating their emotions than others. This is due to their emotional intelligence and awareness
        of their own and others' feelings in various situations. As we progress through these sessions, you too will be
        able to enhance your emotional awareness and benefit your mental health.</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Understanding Emotional Regulation?</h4>
      <p class="mb-5"><span class="intial-concept">How do you usually handle your emotions?</span>The way you do this,
        whether
        positively or negatively, is through your ability to regulate emotions. Emotional regulation is a crucial skill
        for interacting with others and reflecting on your own thoughts. It helps you manage and react to your feelings,
        and like any skill, it takes time and patience to develop.</p>
      <p class="mb-3"><span class="intial-concept">What is Emotional Regulation?</span></p>
      <p>Emotional regulation is the process of recognizing, experiencing, and acting on your emotions. Improving this
        skill boosts your emotional intelligence and mental health. In stressful situations, emotional regulation helps
        you adjust your thoughts and actions to stay calm and focused.</p>
      <p class="mb-3"><span class="intial-concept">​Factors Influencing Emotional Regulation:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Biological Factors:</span>
          Genetics, brain chemistry, and physical health play roles in your ability to regulate emotions.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-1"><span class="intial-concept">Mental Health Conditions:</span>Conditions like depressive,
          anxiety, and
          bipolar disorders can challenge your emotional regulation skills</li>
        <li class="mb-3"><span class="intial-concept">Social and Cultural Factors:</span>Supportive relationships and a
          positive
          community can help you navigate strong emotions. Different cultures may encourage or discourage emotional
          expression, impacting emotional regulation from a young age.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By understanding and improving your emotional regulation, you can better manage stress and enhance your overall
        well-being.​</p>

      <h4 class="sections-title">Life Event Cycle of Emotional Regulation</h4>
      <p>As we go through our day, we encounter situations that may be challenging or stressful, and it isn't always simple to avoid negative emotions. So, what do you do in that scenario? Even a small event can escalate if we let our perspective and analysis lead to more thoughts and feelings that may not be related to the present situation.</p>
      <p>The cycle below illustrates how an event can trigger a cascade of thoughts, bodily reactions, and actions.
