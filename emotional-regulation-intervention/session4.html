            <p>In this fourth session, we will continue to build your knowledge and awareness about how you can be
              better at navigating difficult situations. We will look into the different circumstances around men and
              women impact the ability to express emotions as well as how the cycle of distress can prolong negative
              feelings and stressful situations. Additionally, you will also complete a questionnaire to reflect on your
              experiences with emotions.</p>

              Navigating Strong Emotions – What are they? Why do they happen?
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Managing difficult thoughts and emotions isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It depends on
              each individual and their life circumstances. What works for you might not work for someone else. The key
              is to build your knowledge and tools to improve your mental health and well-being.</p>
            <p class="mb-0"><span class="intial-concept">Gender and Emotional Expression</span></p>
            <p class="mb-3">Men and women may experience the same emotions but process and express them differently,
              often due to societal expectations and cultural differences. For example, men in some cultures are taught
              not to express their emotions, while women are encouraged to talk about their feelings. These differences
              can also vary from household to household. Adolescents can find it challenging to regulate their emotions
              due to growth and developmental changes. The intensity of emotions can shift throughout our lives and even
              from day to day.</p>
            <p class="mb-0"><span class="intial-concept">The Distress Cycle</span></p>
            <p class="mb-3">When strong emotions arise, you might feel the urge to reduce or act upon them immediately.
              This can lead to strong negative feelings, making it difficult to manage the emotions effectively. When
              you seek to avoid or reduce the experience of a negative emotion, you enter what is called the distress
              cycle.</p>
