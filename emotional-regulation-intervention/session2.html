            <p>In this second session, we will build on your understanding about regulating emotions – particularly
              around the most common types of emotions that you may experience in everyday life. We will explore how
              these emotions present themselves including what other types of feelings they are closely associated with.
              In this session, you will also be completing an exercise to help you reflect on how you have navigated
              situations and identify the emotion(s) you have felt then. </p>

            <p class="mb-3">Understanding what triggers your feelings is crucial. Was it an event, a thought, or another
              emotion?</p>
            <p class="mb-3"> Maybe you feel overwhelmed or can’t pinpoint your exact emotion. During such times, it's
              important to listen to your body. Are your arms crossed? Are your shoulders tense? Scanning your body's
              reactions can help you identify your emotions.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">The emotions cards presented below may help you to increase the awareness about most common
              feelings you may experience and what they might be trying to tell you.</p>

              specific situation. Take a moment to fill this table out with a specific event you can remember where you
              had experienced strong feelings. You may complete this exercise more than once and discuss what you wrote
              down with the Mindstride Team. Reflecting on these experiences may help you to better understand and
              manage your emotions.</p>
