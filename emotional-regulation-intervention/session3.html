            <p>In this third session, we will look into the ability to navigate a stressful situation by regulating
              emotions in a positive healthy way. We will provide you with an example of how cognitive reframing, the
              ability to influence how your emotions are felt by changing the meaning of the situation, can increase
              your ability to remain calm and redirect negative thoughts.</p>

              Navigating Stressful Situations with Emotional Regulation​
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-3">Getting into the right frame of mind can be challenging, especially when under stress.
              Stress can overwhelm us and disrupt our emotional balance. However, there are skills, practices, and
              techniques such as movement/exercise, mindfulness, and time management that can help lower stress levels
              and improve emotional processing.?</p>
            <p class="mb-3"><span class="intial-concept">Healthy Expression of Emotions:</span>Expressing your emotions
              in a healthy way is key to emotional regulation. Consider what you currently do to express your emotions.
              How do you react to unpleasant feelings in a situation? By changing the meaning associated with an event,
              you can influence how your emotions are felt—a technique called <span class="intial-concept">cognitive
                reframing.</span></p>
            <p class="mb-5"><span class="intial-concept">Example of Cognitive Reframing:</span> Imagine you have a
              performance review at work and receive constructive criticism about a project. Initially, you might feel
              defensive, but by reframing the situation, you can view it as an opportunity for growth. You decide to
              take the feedback and implement it into your practice.</p>
